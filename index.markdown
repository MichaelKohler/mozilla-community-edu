## Learning, Teaching, Growing

Mozilla Community Education aims to empower Mozillians in their contributions, and personal goals through Education and Training.



> "..the core of the plan is the assumption that we need to build a virtuous circle between 
> 1) participation that helps our products and programs succeed and
> 2) people getting value from participating in Mozilla. ”
>      – [Mark Surman on Mozilla’s Participation Plan for 2015](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/participationplan/)



We believe education and training are a key to empowering community (staff and volunteers) in achieving their goals for personal development and project impact. While many opportunities will launch form the Mozilla Reps program, this initiative is project-wide collaborative initiative.  Everyone is invited.
