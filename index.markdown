## Learning, Teaching, Growing

Mozilla Community Education aims to empower Mozillians in their contributions, and personal goals through Education and Training.



> "..the core of the plan is the assumption that we need to build a virtuous circle between 
> 1) participation that helps our products and programs succeed and
> 2) people getting value from participating in Mozilla. ”
>      – [Mark Surman on Mozilla’s Participation Plan for 2015](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/participationplan/)



We believe education and training are a key to empowering community(staff and volunteers) in achieving their goals for personal development and project impact. While many opportunities will launch form the Mozilla Reps program, this initiative is project-wide collaborative initiative.  Everyone is invited.
