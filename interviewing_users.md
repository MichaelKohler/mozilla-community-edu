<h2>Welcome to the Marketpulse Course: “Interviewing Users for Mozilla”!!</h2>

Thanks so much for registering, I know you probably have a few questions, so I am going to provide an outline of what to expect, as well as a place to ask questions and make suggestions.

Mozilla is interested in technologies beyond the browser and phone, which brings us to our research topic - “Large Screens”.

<blockquote>“Large Screens refer to displays that are larger than the typical computer screen, and/or are being used/viewed by multiple people.”</blockquote>

In this four week course you will learn the important and valuable research skill of user interviewing. Over the next weeks, we’ll walk throughs some basic strategies of research, plan our interviews, practice techniques and finally go out ‘in the field’.

**Each week will follow this format:**

Tuesday  - Email of this week’s topic, activity and share-out.
Thursday - A Google Hangout with one or more of the Marketpulse Team.

FAQ

Question:  Will I get the book ‘Interviewing Users’ and my Wikimedia Note Book before the course starts?
Answer: No, I will be ordering these items on May 26th, and the course starts on May 28th, however I will be emailing you a digital copy of ‘Interviewing Users’ so you will have that while you wait.  The note book is more of a gift, so you should be fine with whatever resources you already have for note taking.   

Question:  When are the Google Hangouts?  
Answer:  Emma will send a link to the group 15 minutes prior to the Hangout start.  You can add the calendar event
