Community Education offers several different modules of training to support contributor impact on Mozilla's project goals.  You'll opportunities offered througought the year (check out the Community Education Calendar from the top menu), and others are available for self-study.

Our work can best be described in these two posts:

* [Community Education](http://tiptoes.ca/mozilla-community-education/)
* [Building Together](http://tiptoes.ca/community-education-part-2/)

And to look into the future, please read Laura Hilligar's Post:

* [Teach Like Mozilla Development](http://www.zythepsary.com/education/teach-like-mozilla-development/)

You can find a lot of us working in community education accross the project on the '[Commmunity Education Call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community_Education_Working_Group)'
