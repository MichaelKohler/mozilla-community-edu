# How does this work?

![LearningIcon]({{site.baseurl}}/img/learn-icon.svg "Learning")


Community Education offers several different modules of training.  You'll find some offered on a regular basis (check out the Community Education Calendar from the top menu), and others are available for self-study.

Our work can best be described in these two posts:

* [Community Education](http://tiptoes.ca/mozilla-community-education/)
* [Building Together](http://tiptoes.ca/community-education-part-2/)

And to look into the future, please read Laura Hilligar's Post:

* [Teach Like Mozilla Development](http://www.zythepsary.com/education/teach-like-mozilla-development/)

You can find a lot of us working in community education accross the project on the '[Commmunity Education Call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Community_Education_Working_Group)'
