# Participation Personas

  Real life contributors are complex and always changing, but these personas will more easily let us enter the headspace of the individuals and their unique perspectives.  As we contemplate participation and learning pathways, we can refer to our personas by name.

### Lenses
  In addition to the Persona attributes and stories, we should apply the following 'lense' to each as a test for diversity, inclusion and overall humanness of Participation design.

* Active/Inactive
* Skill level
* Skillset
* Age
* Gender Identity
* Communication Skills
* Geography/Regional placement
