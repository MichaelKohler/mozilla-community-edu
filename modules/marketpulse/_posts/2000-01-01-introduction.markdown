### An empowered community of Market Researchers united behind Firefox OS!

The Firefox OS team has embarked on many different initiatives and campaigns to bring Firefox OS to market without always having sufficient understanding and knowledge of the reality on the ground, due to a lack of local market data. This local market data is extremely difficult to obtain, let alone, update regularly if you're not actually on the ground. 

In our efforts to be much more data-driven when we think about how we market and ultimately grow Firefox OS, we are launching a global initiative to collect market data for Firefox OS, which we're calling Marketpulse. In support of you, the contributor, we're also launching complementary series of learning opportunities to grow professionally as you contribute.  

Within the Marketpulse education modules you will find helpful tutorials, educational content and real-time opportunities to learn and grow in this exciting field.  

Head over to the [FFOS learning module](/modules/marketpulse_firefox_os/introduction/) to get started!
