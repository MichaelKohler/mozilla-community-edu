### And...
* An existing or potential Marketpulse Contributor ?
* Someone interested in developing a stronger skill-set in Market Research through contribution to Mozilla ?

<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-2x pull-left"></i> It's not mandatory, but definitely a good idea to take training in [Step 1](/modules/marketpulse_activities/step_1/) and [Step 2](modules/marketpulse_activities/step_2/) prior to starting this course.

#What will we research and learn about?
Our topic of research will be "Exploring Technology Beyond the Browser & Phone: Large Screens".


## Is this for me?

Each week, we’ll introduce new topics and facilitate conversations and activities across a range of easy online channels.  This activity will run for 4 weeks beginning, and is self-serve although supported by a in-person Google Hangouts and participatory activities.


* Estimated time: 2hr-4hr/week or as much time as you have. This experience is completely self-serve, with weekly hangouts to discuss topics.
* Equipment needed: Laptop, internet and a G+ account, Mozillians Account
* Skills required: Just an interest in Market Research, the Open Web and applying what you know to help Mozilla collect data in your local area. Oh, and a spirit of adventure :)
* Resource we provide: ["Interviewing Users"](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/) and a [Wikimedia Notebook](http://store.wikimedia.org/products/wikipedia-notebooks).
