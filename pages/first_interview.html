This week's Hangout Link will be posted here just prior to starting.

<h1>Welcome to Week 4 - Your First Interview!</h1>

<blockquote> On one level, documentation is how you capture the definitive, fully detailed record of the interview (the “data”). On another level, it’s how you, as the interviewer, make the 'ah-has' and other important take-aways stick. While doing this, you have to stay engaged with the participant. Beyond that, documentation also bleeds into the sense making and storytelling that follow fieldwork.

You've gone through secondary research, planned an interview and tested your emerging skills on willing friends or family.  You're finally  here - this week you'll conduct your first real interview!
