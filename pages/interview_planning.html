<h1>Welcome to Week 2 - Interview Planning!</h1>

<blockquote>The field guide (sometimes called an interview guide or discussion guide) is a document that details what will happen in the interview. Creating this detailed plan is an essential preparatory step. The interviews themselves never happen as you imagine, but having a detailed plan prepares you to be flexible. </br> - <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/interviewing-users/">Interviewing Users</a></blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br/>
<i class="fa fa-desktop fa-3x pull-left course-icon"></i>
Before you get started on this week's reading and activities, take a moment to consider our subject: "<b>The Large Screen Experience</b>".  What did you learn about this subject during last week's secondary research?  Did you focus primarily on technology and devices?  What did you learn about people during that process?
</p>
<p>
This week, we will begin preparing our interview to better understand how people feel about Large Screens in their lives, businesses,  visions and dreams for the future. As you read this week's material, continually ask yourself 'how can I apply what I am learning to my first interview on the Large Screen Experience'?
</p>

<h4>Happy Researching!</h4>
