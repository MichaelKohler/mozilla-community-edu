This week's Hangout Link will be posted here just prior to starting.

<h1>Welcome to Week 3 - Interview Techniques!</h1>

<blockquote> <b>Interviewing involves more than just interviewing!</b> It is absolutely the core of the interaction with your participant, but there are other techniques (or if you prefer, methods; or if you really prefer, methodologies). You should consider the interview itself as a platform and try to organically integrate a larger set of techniques.</blockquote>

This week we are light on activities, allowing you a chance to catch up on shares from previous weeks and to fully embrace the content in chapters 5 and 6 of our book 'Interviewing Users'.  

<h3>Activities</h3>

In your book "Interviewing Users"

<i class="fa fa-pencil fa-3x pull-left course-icon"></i> <br><br>
<ol>
  <li>Read Chapter 5 “ Key Stages of the Interview ".</li>
  <li>Read Chapter 6 “ How to Ask Questions ”.</li>
</ol>

<b>NOTE:</b>  Although some content in this week's activities covers 'partnering with other for an interview', we won't specifically be working in teams for this course.
