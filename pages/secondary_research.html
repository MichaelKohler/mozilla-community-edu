<h2>Introduction</h2>
<br/>
<i class="fa fa-desktop fa-3x pull-left course-icon"></i>
Mozilla is interested in technologies beyond the browser and phone, and our research topic will be “Large Screens”. 
<br/>
The term <b>"Large Screens"</b> refer to displays that are larger than the typical computer screen, and/or are being used/viewed by multiple people.
<br/>
The <b>first</b> part of any research project is secondary research!

<h2>Secondary Research</h2> 
<br/>
<i class="fa fa-search fa-3x pull-left course-icon"></i>
<b>Secondary Research:</b> involves the summary, collation and/or synthesis of existing research.  This means you spend time researching what information and research already exists on our topic. <u>We are focusing only on Secondary Research for this week.</u>
<br/><b>Primary Research:</b> is research you generate yourself, sometimes called ‘First Hand’ or ‘Desk’ Research. In weeks 2-4 of this course, we will focus on one primary research method - interviewing.)

<blockquote>“In a market research context, secondary research is taken to include the re-use by a second party of any data collected by a first party or parties.”  - Wikipedia </blockquote>

<b>Examples of Secondary Sources:</b>  documentaries, newspapers, magazines, articles, other research reports, white papers, government statistics, YouTube videos, industry associations, books, store flyers/advertising. 
<br/>
<b>Some Topics to Consider:</b> economic and business conditions, industry trends, customer preferences, technological shifts, prices for goods and services, customer demographics and shifts, sales trends.

<h3>Tips:</h3>

<i class="fa fa-bolt fa-3x pull-left course-icon"></i> <br/>
<ul>
<li>If you have access to a local library or university, librarians are amazing resources for conducting secondary research</li>
<li>When at the library, bookstore or market, look at the titles and products nearby for other ideas and information</li>
<li>When searching online, use variations in the combinations of words</li>
<li>In articles, books, and papers, read the footnotes and references at the end for new sources of information and look those up</li>
<li>Question the source. How recent is it? Does it seem legitimate and credible? Can you find more than one instance of it to confirm? (Anybody can make a website!)</li>
<li>Don’t take longer than a few minutes for each topic. Go for breadth (you can do depth later).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Activity & Share!</h2>
 <i class="fa fa-share fa-3x pull-left course-icon"></i> <br/>
<br/>
1. Read <a href="http://www.gv.com/lib/seven-tips-for-lean-market-research">‘Seven Tips for Lean Market Research’</a>  <br/><br/>
2. Research! Gather Sources. Search for news articles, online magazines, consumer reports and other resources you can think of to learn as much as you can about ‘Large Screens’. Add your own knowledge,  and observations about other people’s setups of “Large Screens” to gather secondary research. <b>Make sure you keep track of your sources!</b> <br/><br/>
3. Make sense of what you found. Note important quotes, implications or questions you have after reading each source. Organize your findings into subtopics. See if you feel the need for more research on any of the topics. Note areas you find most interesting, or with gaps to help you guide what research questions you will work towards next week. </br><br/>
4. Share your research! 
<a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/interviewing-users-for-mozilla-secondary-research/2172">On this Discourse thread</a>, through a blog post, or even <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard">Tumblr</a> share your research and your answers to these questions:<br/>
<ul>
<li>How did you organize your research?</li>
<li>Where did you search? And what techniques did you use ? </li>
<li>Do you see any subtopics emerging as a result of your research?</li>
<li>What did you learn about Large Screens that you didn't know before?</li>
<li>What was your overall experience? Was researching fun?  Challenging?  Frustrating?</li>
</ul>
